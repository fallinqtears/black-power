        <h1>About the Nation of Islam</h1>
        <p>Nation of Islam (N.O.I) is a religous group that was <strong>founded in 1930</strong> by <strong>Wallace D. Fard.</strong> This group combined Islamic faith with Black Nationalism and is made up of mostly African Americans. Under Fard's leadership, Nation of Islam promoted black pride and black supermacy which caused it to be seen as racist. N.O.I has done positive things like building schools, but it's often overshadowed by it's controversal comments that targeted Jews and the LGBTQ community. N.O.I has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and most muslims do not consider the N.O.I to be a representation of true Islamic faith.</p>
        
        <p>When Wallace D. Fard left the group, Elijah Muhammad took over. during his leadership, the N.O.I began to expand and started to become well known and it's members grew to about three hundred thousand. The reason for the growing members was because of charismatic NOI leader Malcolm X, who joined the movement in the early 1950s. Malcolm X spread the N.O.I message of black independence and self-defense “by any means necessary” across the U.S. However, his popularity and outspoken nature caused problems within the N.O.I leadership.</p>
  
  <p>In the early 1960s, Malcolm X traveled to the Muslim holy city of Mecca and realized true Islam does not preach that one race is superior to others. When he came back, Malcolm X left the N.O.I. While he continued to promote black empowerment and speak out against racism, he rejected the idea that white people were “devils.” In February 1965, Malcolm X was shot to death at a rally in New York City.</p>
        
        <p>When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, took over as leader of the N.O.I. Mohammed abandoned much of his father’s beliefs and began changing the group’s beliefs closer to those of traditional Islam. This change in direction broke the N.O.I. Most of its members joined Mohammed, who stopped using the name Nation of Islam in the late 1970s.</p>
  
  <p>A smaller group followed popular N.O.I leader Louis Farrakhan, who reformed the Nation of Islam and kept a lot of Elijah Muhammad’s original beliefs. Farrakhan had been a member of the N.O.I since the mid-1950s, and he had been the spokesperson for the group since 1967. Under his leadership, the organization began to focus on making business opportunities for African Americans and fighting drug abuse and poverty in black communities. In the twenty-first century, membership in the Nation of Islam was estimated at between ten thousand and thirty thousand.</p>
