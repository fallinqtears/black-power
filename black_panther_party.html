          <h1>Who Are The Black Panthers?</h1>
        <p>The Black Panther Party was a civil rights organization that believed in black nationalism and, if necessary, violent revolution as a means for African Americans to achieve freedom from white oppression. The Black Panthers sought to end police brutality, reduce the number of African-American men in prisons, provide meals and education for African-American children and, ultimately create a separate society for blacks in the U.S.</p>
          <h1>Origins</h1>
          <p>Originally called the Black Panther Party for Self Defense, the Black Panthers were founded by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California, in 1965 after riots in the impoverished Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles and the assassination of Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X. Although by 1965 the federal government had codified equal rights and protections for people of all races into the law, actual improvements in the lives of poor African-Americans were minimal. To the Black Panthers, the guarantees of equality secured by the Civil Rights Act were not enough. Especially when considered in the context of the country's long history of slavery, segregationist laws, and tolerance for the murderous actions of white supremacists in the K.K.K.</p>
          
          <h1>Black Panther Movement</h1>
          <p>Police brutality against African-Americans was the specific reason for the organization of the Black Panthers. The Panthers considered the ghettos where poor African-Americans lived to be "occupied territories" brutalized by a racist government. So, they believed that jailed black men were "prisoners of war" and that convictions made by white juries were invalid because the defendants had not been tried by a jury of their peers. The Black Panther Party argued that African-Americans should not be drafted to serve in Vietnam because both African-Americans and the people of Vietnam were at war with the U.S. government.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike the more mainstream activists of the civil rights movementâ€”the National Association for Colored People and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  led by  Martin Luther King Jr., the Black Panther Party did not seek as its ultimate goal equality and integration with whites. Nor did the Panthers' founders accept King's peaceful resistance and the NAACP's strategy of securing equality and a guarantee of Constitutional rights through the federal courts. Instead, the Black Panthers advocated violence, revolution, and armed resistance in order to gain complete black independence from whites or any other authority. Whereas King and other Southern civil rights activists dressed in business attire, the Panthers' wardrobe consisted of black leather jackets and black berets, often accessorized with shotguns. There were many confrontations between the Panthers and law enforcement officials, which resulted in shoot-outs, deaths on both sides, and the arrests of Panther members.</p>
    
    <p>In the mid-1970s a rift developed between Black Panther members who wanted to scale back the violence and expand the party's mission to serve all oppressed people and those who wanted to maintain the "Black Power" focus. But the Panthers' stated mission did expand to include community service work, in part to quell its reputation for being solely a paramilitary organization. The Panthers started a free breakfast program for schoolchildren, founded free health clinics, distributed clothing to the needy, and established transportation programs for the elderly and the families of prisoners</p>
          
          <h1>The Impact</h1>
          <p>By the late 1970s the party's infighting and the FBI's pursuit of its members had weakened the organization. The Panthers are considered to have fully disbanded in 1982. Although the group's official membership is believed to have never exceeded five thousand, the Black Panthers had achieved worldwide fame. Their efforts inspired militant movements among other minority groups, including Mexican Americans in Southern California (who formed the Brown Berets), Chinese Americans in San Francisco (the Red Guards), and even a group of angry senior citizens (the Gray Panthers). The Black Panther Party remains a symbol of Black Power and the counterculture movements of the 1960s.</p>
