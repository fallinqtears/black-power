        <h1>About the S.N.C.C</h1>
      <p>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was founded in 1960. It started from an incident on February 1, 1960, where four black college students attempted to sit and be served at a lunch counter in Woolworth's, a store in Greensboro, North Carolina . In most southern states, seating in such public places was strictly segregated according to race, and blacks were prohibited from sitting at the counter. This protest started the student sit-in movement that spread through the South. Reacting to the upsurge of student activism, Southern Christian Leadership Conference official Ella Baker invited student protest leaders to a weekend conference. The student leaders expressed their frustration with the slow pace of the major civil rights organizations. Ready to confront the racism and segregation around them, they agreed to form SNCC. The founders agreed that SNCC would use nonviolent but active and confrontational tactics to provoke social change.</p>
        
        
        <h1>Activism</h1>
        <p>In February 1961, four students affiliated with SNCC traveled to Rock Hill, South Carolina , to join a group of protesters arrested at a segregated lunch counter. There, the SNCC members formed a “jail-no-bail” or “jail-in” strategy. So many protestors were imprisoned—and refused to be released on bail, that the local jails faced overcrowding.</p>
      
        <p>In May 1961, SNCC rallied when a group organized by the Congress of Racial Equality went on freedom rides to defy segregation policies on buses and in bus stations. The freedom riders encountered violence in Alabama and were forced to give up their campaign. SNCC members knew it would be a terrible signal to white segregationists to learn that their violence had stopped a civil rights effort. So, they organized a lot of black students to take the place of the original freedom riders. The students risked their lives to ride buses from Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested and put in jail.</p>
