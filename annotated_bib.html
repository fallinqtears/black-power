      <strong>I learned the Nation of Islam (NOI) was seen as a hateful group due to many controversial comments made about other groups of people. The NOI may be a hateful group, but It's still a part of the black power movement and it needs to be included. This source was very informative.</strong>

        <h2>Choosing My Topic</h2>
  <p>When looking through the list of topics I could choose from and Black Power is what stuck out to me the most. Only hearing about this topic during Black History Month, I wanted to explore it more. After doing a tiny amount of research on the Black Power Movement before using it as my topic, I found that it fit the theme well, so I chose it. Wanting to learn more about black history (and wanting to get a good grade) is what pushed me to choose my topic.</p>
  
        <h2>Researching My Topic</h2>
  
       <p> After choosing the topic, the next thing that came was research. For me to finish my project, I needed to conduct good research so, I went to BCPS One for that. I looked through all the online Libraries and found reliable sources. I organized my research into two key parts, one being what the Movement was about and the second being the important figures in the movement. Conducting this research was beneficial to me, because I learned a lot about my topic and a lot about my history.</p>
  
        <h2>Selecting My Presentation Category</h2>
    
  <p>When I looked at the options for how I would do my presentation, making a website is what caught my interest. When I saw it had to be made using a Wix template I became a little disappointed, because I thought I would be able to code it myself. When I attempted to use the website, I wouldn’t allow me to create anything on it, so I decided to code it myself. I’m glad that I was able to code it myself, because it shows my skills and it’s a learning experience for me.</p>
  
        <h2>How Does My Topic Relate to The Theme?</h2>
  <p>My project topic, Black Power relates to the theme breaking barriers in history. It relates to the theme because this movement helped African-Americans break through racial and social barriers. The Black Power Movement also allowed Black people to fight for social and political equality.</p>
